Approach for predicting:
1. Hypothesis is already given in the question is Predict the probability of making payment by
costumer
2. Load data, read data and all the other basic commands used to look at data.
3. Missing value is treated:
(i) There are four columns have missing values.
(ii) For filling missing value ‘fillna’ function is used with mean and max value.
4. Univariate analysis is performed on data:
(i) “Age in days” column had large value so transformed to reduced error in prediction.
(ii) “perc_premium_paid_by_cash_credit” column has skewness, so that transformed.
5. Bivariate Analysis is also performed:
(i) Correlation is calculated between all continues variable and seems no variable is very
less or very high correlated to the target variable.

6. Outlier treatment:
(i) Box plotting and IQR detect outlier.
(ii) Outliers replaced with mean or max value of that column.
7. Predictive modeling:
(i) Linear regression used and validated with validation data set and auc score is calculated.
(ii) Logistic regression used and validated with validation data set and auc score is
calculated.
(iii) Decision tree used and validated with validation data set and auc score is calculated.
(iv) Found that auc score for linear regression is highest among these and used to predict
final solution.
(v) Catboost and xgboost is also more accurate for the dataset but not used as mention in
contest rule-“ use only those algorithms and concepts that have been taught in the
training”

8. Submission: a csv file crated with ‘id’ and ‘target’ columns and in target, the predicted
probability is stored.
